### Changelog

Put any changes you've made here so we can let the community know what is in the newest build

- Updated searching to be word based. Results will contain all words, not just the entire search query in a single attribute.
  - Example: "male villian" search will return all cards that are of type male and of type villain.
  - Side Sffect: female villians will also match in this search, so will Wonder Woman, who's decription says "+3 for each Female Villain"
